# Building Vision Transformer From Scratch For Image Classification
In this notebook, we are going to implement the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** from scratch using PyTorch, and use the model to perform image classification for different breeds of dogs. 

The reserach paper, ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), introduced a Vision Transformer into computer vision, delivering state-of-the-art performance without using convolution networks. The idea is motivated from the widely acclaimed Transformer architecture in the domain of natural language processing (NLP). Our objective in replicating the paper is to grasp the essential concepts in the Vision Transformer. 

- **Task 1**: Develop Vision Transformer from scratch
- **Task 2**: Apply image classification to identify different dog breeds
